    "To eradicate the problem of this traffic being created at the end of the road, I chose to revert back to an initial generatioon of the cars in accorance to the density required. This was done by iterating through the number of cars that would need to be generated, from the road length times density, and generating a random number between 0 and the length of the road, to represent a space on the road and if this space was unoccupied a car with a random velocity would be generated, if this space was taken a new index would be generated and it would loop until an empty space was found.\n",

    "To eradicate the problem of this traffic being created at the end of the road, I chose to revert back to an initial generatioon of the cars in accorance to the density required. This was done by iterating through the number of cars that would need to be generated, from the road length times density, and generating a random number between 0 and the length of the road, to represent a space on the road and if this space was unoccupied a car with a random velocity would be generated, if this space was taken a new index would be generated and it would loop until an empty space was found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon thinking about how the two systems work, it only makes sense for a periodic road to have cars generated initially and then stay on the road, while the open system, which is more realistic of a road would have cars generated throughout the iterations. Thus it will be an important task to go back to the open system and incorperate the concept of setting a density, however for now I will persue with the periodic system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon observation the density of the cars seems to be dropping as time goes on, and thus there is a flaw in the system that will need irradicating.\n",
    "The first change to make was in rule one, expanding the range to enclude the cars on the extra generated portion of road to move. However this doesn't completely irradatate the problem. By adding each rule in one by one it can be seen that the probelem lay in the implementation of rule 4.\n",
